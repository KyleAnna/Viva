# Viva Glint Licensing

Subscription plans of Viva suite or Viva Glint are required for using Microsoft Viva Glint. The total number of active licenses in your subscriptions should be greater than or equal to the number of active users in the app. 

## Notifications for exceeding licenses

If the number of active users in Viva Glint exceeds the subscription purchase, you'll be notified via email, and you'll have a 45-day grace period to take one of the following actions:

- Purchase extra Microsoft Viva suite or Viva Glint licenses according to the product terms; 
- Remove excess active users from the Viva Glint instance by marking them “INACTIVE.”  

## What happens if the grace period expires?

If the grace period expires and you haven't taken any of the actions described above, some Viva Glint key functionalities won't work as expected. 

>[!NOTE]
>If a customer purchases additional licenses to remedy the license shortage, it could take up to 24 hours to re-enable survey creation features in the app.
